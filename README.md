1. Movie Genre Classification
This project focuses on predicting the genre(s) of movies based on attributes such as the title, plot summary, cast, and keywords. The dataset typically consists of movie metadata, including textual information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to preprocess the text, including tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords. Feature extraction is done using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings. The classification task involves using machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or Neural Networks to predict genres. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the modelâ€™s performance. This project highlights the ability to handle multilabel classification problems effectively.

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset containing details like transaction amount, timestamp, and anonymized numerical features. One major challenge is the class imbalance, as fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), undersampling, or class weighting are used to address this imbalance. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost are trained to identify fraud patterns. The model is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, as accuracy alone can be misleading due to class imbalance. This project demonstrates expertise in anomaly detection and imbalanced data handling.

3. Customer Churn Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to stop using a service, known as churn, based on historical data. Features include customer demographics, subscription details, and usage patterns (e.g., frequency of service use, payment history). Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data. Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks are trained to predict churn. Feature importance is analyzed to identify the most influential factors contributing to churn. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. This project helps businesses proactively address customer retention.

4. Spam SMS Detection
This project involves building a system to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The dataset typically contains labeled messages. Preprocessing steps include cleaning the text, removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and applying techniques like tokenization and stopword removal. Feature extraction is performed using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings. Machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained for binary classification. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. This project highlights skills in NLP, binary classification, and model optimization.
